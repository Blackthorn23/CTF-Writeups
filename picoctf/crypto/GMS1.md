### Steps:
#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Connecting to the Challenge
First, let's connect to the server using `nc` (netcat) to see what the challenge is about.

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Understanding the Challenge
We are given **two options**:  
- **(e)** Encrypt a cheese name  
- **(g)** Guess the original cheese from an encrypted version  

However, we only have **three attempts** in total‚Äî**two encryption attempts and one guess**.

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Identifying the Cipher Type  
From the encrypted outputs of two different cheese names, we can determine that this is a **monoalphabetic substitution cipher**. But which specific type?  

#### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Analyzing the Hint  
The hint references **"affinity for linear equations"**, which strongly suggests an **Affine Cipher**.  
To confirm this, we checked with ChatGPT about possible ciphers that match this pattern:

#### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Solving the Affine Cipher  
The **Affine Cipher** follows the encryption formula:

\[
E(x) = (a \cdot x + b) \mod 26
\]

To decrypt, we use:

\[
D(x) = a^{-1} \cdot (x - b) \mod 26
\]

Using the encryptions of two known cheese names, we can solve for `a` and `b`, then decrypt the given cheese name:

I wrote a Python script to automate this decryption:
