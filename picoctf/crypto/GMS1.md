### The given hint:  
> Remember that cipher we devised together, Squeexy?  
> The one that incorporates your affinity for linear equations???

### Steps:
1. Let's nc into the server first to see our challenge

2. Given 2 option to encrypt a message (e) or guess the cheese (g), we only have 3 attemps which means (2 encryptions and 1 guess)

3. By the given encrypted cheeses, we can know that it is a Monoalphabetic Cipher. But which cipher is it?
   
4. Based on the given hint, we asked chatgpt to give us the type of possible cipher the challenge used.
