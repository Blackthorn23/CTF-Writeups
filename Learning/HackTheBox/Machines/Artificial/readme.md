# ü§ñ HackTheBox - Artificial

![Artificial Banner](picture1.png)



## üéØ Overview

Artificial is an Easy-rated Linux machine on HackTheBox that leverages **artificial intelligence** themes and technologies. This machine appears to be newly released (June 2025) and has gained significant attention from the community with thousands of successful solves.

## üîç Reconnaissance

### Initial Ping scan

Let's start by pinging the TARGET IP
![Machine Preview](picture2.png)

### Initial Nmap Scan

Now perform a basic port scan to identify open services:

```bash
sudo nmap -sVC <TARGET IP>
```

![Initial Nmap Scan](picture3.png)

**Results:**
```
PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 8.9p1 Ubuntu 3ubuntu0.x (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
80/tcp open  http    nginx 1.18.0 (Ubuntu)
```

### Host File Configuration

This allowed me to access the website directly by visiting http://artificial.htb.

### Service Enumeration

#### HTTP Service (Port 80)

Let's explore the web application (Login page):

![Web Application Homepage](picture5.png)

Create a user and login using the credentials:

![Gobuster Results](picture6.png)

After logging in, I was redirected to a dashboard that allows managing and uploading AI models (But with a little requirements):

![Whatweb Results](picture7.png)

#### AI Model Requirements 

The application clearly required uploaded models to be built with TensorFlow CPU version 2.13.1. To assist with this, it even provided a reference Dockerfile for building compatible environments:

## üö™ Gaining Initial Access

### Vulnerability Discovery

I found a public repository demonstrating how to abuse TensorFlow‚Äôs model loading mechanism for RCE https://github.com/Splinter0/tensorflow-rce/.

**Step 1: Cloning the Exploit Repository**

I cloned the repo and verified the exploit scripts were available:

![Vulnerability Discovery](picture9.png)

![AI Interface Analysis](picture10.png)

**Step 2: Writing the Malicious Exploit**

Using the exploit.py script that creates a malicious .h5 TensorFlow model containing a reverse shell payload, I changed the IP and PORT to my attacker machine.

**Step 3: Building the Docker Image**

I copied the prepared Dockerfile into the repo and built the container, then I launched a container with a mounted shared volume:

![Payload Crafting](picture11.png)

**Step 4: Generating the Malicious Model**

I executed the script to generate exploit.h5:

![Initial Shell Commands](picture14.png)

**Step 5: Setting up a Listener**

On my attacking machine, I set up a Netcat listener on port 4444 to catch the reverse shell:

![Initial Shell Commands](picture17.png)

**Step 6: Uploading the Malicious Model**

Back on the target‚Äôs dashboard, I uploaded the crafted exploit.h5 model and execute it by (View Predictions):

**Accessing User Account:**

Wolla! We gained the initial access to the system:

![User Account Access](picture18.png)

### üèÜ User Flag

**Step 1: Exploring the Application Directory**

After gaining a shell, I enumerated the /app directory and found an SQLite database inside the instance folder.

![User Flag](picture19.png)

Step 2: Extracting User Credentials
I opened the database and dumped the contents of the user table, the database contained usernames, emails, and MD5 password hashes.

![LinPEAS Results](picture20.png)

**Step 3: Preparing Hashes for Cracking**

I copied the database result into a text file (hashes.txt) and remain only the hashes.

![Sudo Permissions](picture21.png)

![SUID Binaries](picture22.png)

**Step 4: Cracking Hashes with John the Ripper**

Using john with the rockyou.txt wordlist, I successfully cracked 4 out of 7 passwords.

```bash
gael : mattp005numbertwo

mark : marvinnarak043414036

john : john

kali : kali
```

![Root Processes](picture23.png)

**Step 5: Privilege Escalation to User**

I switched user to gael using the cracked credentials and retrieved the user.txt flag in the home directory.

![Payload Execution](picture25.png)

**User Flag:** `239b3032f78802d747f220031daec97e`

## üèÅ Root Flag

**Step 1: SSH into the server**
SSH as User gael:

![Root Access](picture26.png)

But User gael is not in the sudo group:

![Root Access](picture27.png)

**Step 2: Escalation Enumeration with LinPEAS**
After securing the user foothold, I transferred and executed LinPEAS to enumerate privilege escalation vectors.

![Root Access](picture28.png)

![Root Directory](picture29.png)

During the scan, LinPEAS highlighted a suspicious file in /var/backups ‚Äî a large archive owned by root.

![Root Directory](picture30.png)

![Root Directory](picture31.png)

**Step 3: Downloading the Backup Archive**
Inside /var/backups, I found backrest_backup.tar.gz. To analyze it locally, I started a Python HTTP server and exfiltrated the file to my attacker machine.

![Root Directory](picture32.png)

**Step 4: Extracting Backup Contents**
I extracted the archive and discovered configuration files, SQLite databases, and logs. Among these, a file named config.json stood out.

![Root Directory](picture34.png)

**Step 5: Finding Credentials**
Inspecting the config file revealed credentials for a privileged user backrest_root, with the password stored as a crypt hash.

![Root Directory](picture34.png)

**Step 6: Cracking the Hash**
I extracted the bcrypt hash, saved it into backrest.hash, and used John the Ripper with the rockyou.txt wordlist to crack it.

![Root Directory](picture35.png)

The cracked password was:
```bash
!@#$%^
```
**Step 7: Enumerating Internal Services**
After gaining the credentials for the backrest, I checked for running services with:

```bash
ss -tulpn
```
![Root Directory](picture36.png)

I found several interesting ports bound to localhost only, including 5000 (Flask app) and 9898 (Backrest panel).

**Step 8: SSH Port Forwarding to Access Services**

To reach these internal services, I used SSH tunneling:

```bash
ssh -L 5000:127.0.0.1:5000 gael@<TARGET IP>
ssh -L 9898:127.0.0.1:9898 gael@<TARGET IP>
```

**Step 9: Visit the websites**

![Root Directory](picture38.png)
![Root Directory](picture40.png)

**Step 10: Logging into Backrest**
I logged in using the credentials backrest_root.

![Root Directory](picture41.png)

**Step 11: Creating a Repository**
Using restic, I created a new repository at /home/gael/myrepo and set a password.

```bash
/opt/backrest/restic -r /home/gael/myrepo init
/opt/backrest/restic -r /home/gael/myrepo key passwd
```
![Root Directory](picture42.png)

Then I linked it inside Backrest‚Äôs web panel:

![Root Directory](picture43.png)

**Step 12: Backing up /root Directory**

From the Backrest web UI, I executed a backup command to archive /root.

![Root Directory](picture44.png)

**Step 13: Accessing the Snapshot**
Inside the repo, I located the snapshot:

![Root Directory](picture45.png)

Then from the Backrest web UI, I executed a list command on the snapshot id.
![Root Directory](picture46.png)

Dumping the snapshot files revealed the root.txt flag. üéâ
